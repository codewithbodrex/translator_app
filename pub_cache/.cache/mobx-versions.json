Observables carry the reactive state; Reactions observe the observable state and cause side-effects in the application; Actions are used to cause mutations on the observable-state.\nMobX also determines the dependencies of a Reaction automatically with no explicit wiring. This makes it a library that advocates Transparent Functional Reactive Programming (TFRP).
